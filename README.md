Making dynamic GUI based on GPT response

## Requirements

Spending only 20 minutes to make this.

Read and analyze `script.py, main.py, scrollArea.py` to figure out how i did this.

1. git clone ~
2. pip install -r requirements.txt

- Display tubular data as a table on the GUI from the GPT response. Don't dynamically set the GUI as a whole; But show data in the table dynamically.
- Note: There is almost no difference between this one and pyqt-gpt-json-example aside from right side of the screen. Which means you can make your own GPT response example with my widgets :)
- Especially, `apiWidget.py` is used in my any OpenAI-related project all the time.
